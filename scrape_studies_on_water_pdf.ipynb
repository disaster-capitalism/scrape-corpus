    "# Scrape Text from Corpus \"Studies on Water\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we extract the text data from the series of reports \"Studies on Water\" issued by the OECD ([link](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/environment/oecd-studies-on-water_22245081)). The 55 reports range from the years 2009 to 2022 and form the corpus for the project \"Markets for Resilience or Disaster Capitalism\". The pdf versions of the reports are not openly available but must be purchased from the OECD library. Therefore, they are not included in this repository. This notebooks contains code to extract the text from the pdf versions, which must be placed in the directory `pdf/`. For text extraction from pdf files, we use the package `pymupdf` (i.e., `fitz`). The extracted text is stored in json files for each report in the directory `studies_on_water_scraped/` (as well as a big json file including all reports called `studies_on_water_scaped.json`). The individual json files contain an object with a key for each top-level chapter (including preface, table of contents, etc.) plus a key for the meta data of the report (e.g., author, date). Each top-level chapter contains an array with each element being a line from the chapter (with subheaders as a separate line). **NOTE**: The extracted text may still be quite messy and probably needs further cleaning in many cases. The json file containing all chapters is an array with each element being a report object as just described."
