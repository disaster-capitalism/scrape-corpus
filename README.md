# Scrape the Corpus "Studie on Water"
This repository contains the code for scraping the corpus "Studies on Water" issued by the OECD. This is done in the notebook `scrape_studies_on_water_pdf.ipynb`. Please note that to run the notebook the pdf documents of the corpus (which can be purchased from the OECD website) need to be stored in a `pdf/` folder.
